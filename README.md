Intro
-----
Crypton is a free open source project derived from NovaCoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient Proof of Stake based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin and NovaCoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/Cryptond (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/Cryptond (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 

18775 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Crypton works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Crypton network.


Upgrade
-------
All you existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade first backup wallet
Cryptond backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown Cryptond by
Cryptond stop
Start up the new Cryptond.
